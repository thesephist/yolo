So, here we are. Presenting: **[the yolo page](https://thesephist.github.io/yolo/)**

On the yolo page, anything goes. This is a public GitHub repository, and I'll merge any pull request you make. But there are some ground rules:

> Rules!

1. No modifying README.md or this rules section, down to the <hr/>
1. No spamming or advertising
1. No potential security issues -- e.g. no random third-party scripts
1. Please try not to hide/move this rules notice or the contributors section below :) but you're free to improve it!

You can see much more on the actual site ^^

Here's what it's starting out as, on the morning of August 14, 2020:
